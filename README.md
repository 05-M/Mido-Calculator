# Mido's Kotlin & Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I'm building as part of my learning journey with Kotlin and Python.

## 1. Simple To-Do List App (Kotlin)

A command-line application to manage your daily tasks, built entirely in Kotlin.

**Features:**

*   Add new tasks.
*   View all tasks with their status (Pending/DONE).
*   Mark tasks as complete.
*   Remove tasks.
*   Interactive command-line interface.
*   Built using Kotlin fundamentals: variables, control flow, loops, functions, and basic OOP concepts (data classes for Tasks), and collections (MutableList).

**Files:**

*   `src/TodoApp.kt`: Contains the main logic for the To-Do list application.
*   `src/GuessingGame.kt`: (Previously developed) A number guessing game.
*   `src/GradeCalculator.kt`: (Previously developed) A simple grade calculator.

**How to Run (To-Do App):**

1.  Make sure you have Kotlin SDK and a JDK installed.
2.  Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or compile and run `TodoApp.kt` from the command line).
3.  Run the `main` function in `TodoApp.kt`.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts.

## 2. OOP Calculator (Python)

A simple command-line calculator built with Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This was one of the initial projects to understand OOP.

**Features:**

*   Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
*   Exponentiation (**)
*   Modulus (%)
*   Integer Division (//)
*   Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
*   Square Root (sqrt)
*   Natural Logarithm (log)
*   Error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.

**File:**

*   `calc_oop.py`: The Python script for the calculator.

**How to Run (Python Calculator):**

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script using: `python calc_oop.py`
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts.
